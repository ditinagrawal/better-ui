## Building the registry locally

To test that your registry builds correctly, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm registry:build
```

Then try installing any component from the registry in a new project using the `shadcn add` command:

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:4321/r/<component-name>.json
```
