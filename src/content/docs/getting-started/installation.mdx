description: How to install Better UI components in your project.

import AllPackageManager from "@/components/astro/all-package-manager.astro";
import { publicEnv } from "@/lib/env";

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing Better UI components is as simple as running the `shadcn add` command followed by the URL to the component you want to install. This URL will always be formatted as <code>{publicEnv.BETTER_UI_URL}/r/\<component-name\>.json</code>.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<AllPackageManager
  action="run"
  pkg={`shadcn@latest add ${publicEnv.BETTER_UI_URL}/r/action-button.json`}
/>
